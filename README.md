## 📊 Proposed Strategies
1. **Seasonal Promotions**  
   Offer membership discounts & perks during **peak casual rider months** (July–August) or the summer season.  

2. **Exclusive Membership Benefits**  
   Partner with top **restaurants, entertainment venues, and attractions** to offer special discounts and VIP access only for annual members. Seeing annual members enjoy these privileges could make casual riders feel they’re missing out.  

3. **Loyalty & Referral Program**  
   Introduce a **point-based reward system** where only annual members earn points for rides, referrals, or social media shares. Points can be redeemed for **free rides, exclusive merchandise, or priority bike access**, motivating casual riders to upgrade.

With exclusive perks and strategic promotions, Cyclistic can make annual membership more desirable, encouraging casual riders to subscribe and boosting long-term retention.
